A Lunar Lander in Javascript

This studentprojecct was coded using html, javascript, css and jquery-2.1.4.
It was tested in Firefox ver. 39 and Chrome and Chrome ver. 46.

While I used the Internet as my friend and helper and I didn't write every bit of Code myself, I maintain most of the Ownership.
Please give me credit, should you use this as reference.
That includes any of my fellow students.
Even if you were to use this, I can't guarantee, that it is correct, because I didn't the presets we were given.

Use with caution!
